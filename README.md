# DTInstagramPhotos
Get instagram photos from their API for iOS

## Dependencies
This library will not work without the support of these great open source libraries:  
1. [AFNetworking 2.x](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)  
2. [GSKeychain](https://github.com/goosoftware/GSKeychain)  
3. [RegExCategories](https://github.com/bendytree/Objective-C-RegEx-Categories)  

## How to use
1. Register your app on the developer account  
 - Go to the [Register New Client page](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/)  
 - Put your REDIRECT URI as this format: **yourappname://authorize**. This is a scheme URL you will gonna register on the xcode  

2. Set up your scheme URL on xcode  
Go to your **Project Target**, on the **Info** tab at the bottom you will see the **URL Types**. Add new URL Type, on the **URL Schemes** put yourappname (the same as the above).  

3. Drag all the files here to your project  

4. Edit AppDelegate.m  
Put `#import "DTInstagramPhotos.h"` at the top, and put this code at the bottom:  

```ObjectiveC
-(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
  [DTInstagramPhotos handleURL:url];
  return YES;
}
```

5. On your ViewController.m (It can be any file) you wanted  
Put `#import "DTInstagramPhotos.h"` at the top,  and followed by:

```ObjectiveC
@interface ViewController () {
    DTInstagramPhotos *instagram;
}
```

```ObjectiveC
instagram = [[DTInstagramPhotos alloc] init];
if ([instagram loggingIn]) {
    [instagram getPhotos:^(id JSON) {
        NSLog(@"All Photos: %@", JSON);
    }];
}
```

Receive the notification when the user logged in for the first time  

```ObjectiveC
-(void) viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
  // notification to receive the photos when user logged in for the first time
  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(DTInstagramNotification:) name:@"DTInstagram" object:nil];
}

-(void) DTInstagramNotification:(NSNotification *) notification {
  NSDictionary *notificationData = notification.userInfo;
  if ([[notificationData objectForKey:@"type"] isEqualToString:@"readyGetPhoto"]) {
    [instagram getPhotos:^(id JSON) {
      NSLog(@"All Photos: %@", JSON);
    }];
  }
}
```
